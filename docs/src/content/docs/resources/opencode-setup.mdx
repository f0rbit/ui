This guide explains how to set up @f0rbit/ui with [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), an AI coding assistant.

## Quick Setup

Run this command in your terminal to automatically install and configure @f0rbit/ui with OpenCode:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://f0rbit.github.io/ui/opencode/setup.sh | bash
```

This script will:
1. Detect your package manager (bun, pnpm, or npm)
2. Install `@f0rbit/ui`
3. Download the OpenCode skill for AI assistance

## Manual Setup

### Step 1: Install the Package

```bash
# bun
bun add @f0rbit/ui

# npm
npm install @f0rbit/ui

# pnpm
pnpm add @f0rbit/ui
```

### Step 2: Add the OpenCode Skill

Create the skill directory and download the skill file:

```bash
mkdir -p .opencode/skill/f0rbit-ui
curl -sL https://f0rbit.github.io/ui/opencode/skill.md \
  -o .opencode/skill/f0rbit-ui/SKILL.md
```

### Step 3: (Optional) Add the Setup Command

If you want a reusable command for setting up @f0rbit/ui in other projects:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/command
curl -sL https://f0rbit.github.io/ui/opencode/setup-ui.md \
  -o ~/.config/opencode/command/setup-ui.md
```

Now you can run `/setup-ui` in any OpenCode session.

## Using with OpenCode

Once set up, OpenCode will automatically discover the `f0rbit-ui` skill. When you're working on a task that involves @f0rbit/ui, the agent can load the skill to get full context about:

- Available components and their props
- CSS design tokens for theming
- Utility classes
- Code examples

### Example Prompts

```
Help me create a login form using @f0rbit/ui components
```

```
Explain the theming system in @f0rbit/ui and how to customize colors
```

```
Create a dashboard layout with Card, Stat, and Status components
```

## Monorepo Support

The setup script automatically detects monorepo structures. If you're in a monorepo, it will prompt you to choose which package to install @f0rbit/ui in.

For manual monorepo setup:

```bash
# Install in a specific workspace
cd packages/web
bun add @f0rbit/ui

# The skill should be at the repo root
cd ../..
mkdir -p .opencode/skill/f0rbit-ui
curl -sL https://f0rbit.github.io/ui/opencode/skill.md \
  -o .opencode/skill/f0rbit-ui/SKILL.md
```

## Updating the Skill

To update the skill with the latest documentation:

```bash
curl -sL https://f0rbit.github.io/ui/opencode/skill.md \
  -o .opencode/skill/f0rbit-ui/SKILL.md
```
